# Module-14 - Full Stack React: Kanban Board

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with adding authentication with JWT to an existing Kanban board application. It was my job to complete the UI for the login page, add authentication with JWT to the server API, and then deploy the entire application to Render.
